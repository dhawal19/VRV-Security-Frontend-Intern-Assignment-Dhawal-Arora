# Admin Dashboard

This project is a responsive admin dashboard featuring a central modal for actions (like adding users), a dynamic data table, and seamless integration of a sidebar and navbar for easy navigation. I wanted to add an
auditing feature but couldn't due to ongoing exams. But I tried to include stuff I could with the time I had.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on all screen sizes.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Easily toggle the sidebar to access key sections.
- **Navbar**: Includes action buttons to trigger modals or key functionalities.
- **Modal**: Centrally aligned modal triggered by navbar or sidebar buttons.
- **Dynamic Data Table**:
  - Displays user data fetched from the backend.
  - Includes "Edit" and "Delete" actions for each row.
- **Context API**:
  - Centralized state management for user data and modal visibility.
  - Simplifies prop drilling and enhances reusability.
